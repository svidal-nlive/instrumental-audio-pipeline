### 🔧 What You Need to Do Next

**DNS Configuration Required**: You need to add these DNS records to your `vectorhost.net` domain:

```
instrumental.vectorhost.net      A    [YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]
instrumental-api.vectorhost.net  A    [YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]
```

Replace `[YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]` with the public IP address of this server.

### 🧪 Testing Locally (Optional)

If you want to test before setting up DNS, add these entries to your local `/etc/hosts` file:

```
[YOUR_SERVER_IP]  instrumental.vectorhost.net
[YOUR_SERVER_IP]  instrumental-api.vectorhost.net
```

### 🛠️ Management Commands

```bash
# View service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml logs -f

# Restart services  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml restart

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d --build

# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml ps
```

### 🔒 Security Notes

- SSL certificates will be automatically obtained from Let's Encrypt when accessed via proper domain names
- Authentication middleware is available but currently disabled
- To enable OAuth authentication, uncomment the middleware lines in `docker-compose.traefik.yml`

### ✨ Features Available

Once DNS is configured, your dashboard will have:
- 📤 File upload functionality
- 📊 Job monitoring and management  
- 🎵 Music library browsing and playback
- 🔧 API testing through interactive documentation
- 🔄 Hot-reloading for development

The system is production-ready and waiting for DNS configuration! 🚀
